I don't like you T-Series
Nothing personal, kid
But I must go all out
Just this once

Bobs or vegana, whichever will it be?
Sit the fuck down T-Series
I'm here to spill the real tea
You tryna dethrone me from spot on number one
But you India, you lose so best think you haven't won
When I'm through with you we're gonna be completely fucking done
'Cause we only just begun
I review you
Zero
Bye, bitch, gone
So come on T-Series
Looking hungry for some drama
Here let me serve your bitch lasagna

Bitch, lasagna
Bitch, lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch, lasagna
Bitch, lasagna
Bitch, lasagna
Look at T-Series they just crying for their momma
Bitch, lasagna
Bitch, lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch, lasagna
Bitch, lasagna
Bitch, lasagna
T-Series just wet themselves in their pajamas

So who the hell is Bob, and why you wanna kiss him? (ew)
I'm a blue eyes white dragon, while you're just dark magician (oof)
You got a fifth of the population in your nation but
I got nine year olds of worlds so hold your defecation (oops)
Motu Patlu, what the fuck is that even supposed to mean?
Your language sounds like it come from a mumble rap community
No papa, no papa, yes papa, Johnny
Now down all of this sugar and let's throw this fucking party with some-

Bitch, lasagna
Bitch, lasagna
Look at T-Series they just crying for their momma
Bitch, lasagna
Bitch, lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch, lasagna
Bitch, lasagna
Bitch, lasagna
Look at T-Series they just wet in their pajamas
Bitch, lasagna
Bitch, lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch, lasagna

You got a population of 1.32 billion
But most your videos can't seem to hit even a million

Sub-bot!
